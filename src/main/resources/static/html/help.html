    <h2>URL shortener help</h2>

    <p>
        This is prototype of URL shortener web service. To run it just enter command <i>gradlew bootRun</i> in
        project root or <i>gradlew build</i> and then <i>java -jar build/libs/urlshort-0.0.1.jar</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Application will bind to address <i>127.0.0.1:8080</i> and have prefix <i>/short/</i> by default but you
        can change this in <i>src/main/resources/application.properties</i> file. This file also includes admin's
        login and password (they are 'admin' and 'admin' by default) which can be used to access any account's
        statistic. Later in this document default settings will be assumed.
    </p>

    <p>
        First you must register an account by performing a POST request to URL
        <i>http://127.0.0.1:8080/short/account</i> with chosen account's id in JSON body
        <i>{"AccountId":"{AccountId"}</i>. On success you will receive password for that account in response body:
        <i>{"success":true,"description":"Your account is opened","password":"{password}"}</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Send a POST request to URL <i>http://127.0.0.1:8080/short/register</i> with authorization header which includes
        your account's id and password. JSON body of this request must include url and redirect type:
        <i>{"url":"{url}","redirectType":{redirectType}}</i>. URL can be anything and redirect type must be 301 or 302.
        You can omit redirect type altogether, it will be 302 by default then. In response JSON body there will be
        short url <i>{"shortUrl":"{shortUrl"}</i>. You can use that to redirect to registered url.
    </p>

    <p>
        To view account's statistic go to <i>http://127.0.0.1:8080/short/statistic/{accountId}</i>. You must authorize
        either using accessed account's credentials or by using admin's login and password. Response JSON body will
        contain long URLs and counts of redirects to them like this: <i>{"{url1}":{count1},"{url2}":{count2},...}</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        All data in this prototype is stored in memory so it will be lost on application restart.
